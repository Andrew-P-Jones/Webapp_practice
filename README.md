**Project Title**: Dajngo Data Science Project 

**Project Description**: Use Django to create a web application that reads an api and displays the data in a chart.

**Project Goals**: Have a chart display data from an api. Have a button to trigger the api call and chart update. Use linear regression to predict future data points.

1. Navigate to the django project folder in the terminal
2. Run this in the terminal "python manage.py runserver"
3. Go to the url "http://127.0.0.1:8000/
