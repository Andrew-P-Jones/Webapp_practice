## Overview

**Project Title**: Data Analysis with Flask

**Project Description**: Using Lets-plot and Flask to create a web application that allows see trends in stock data.

**Project Goals**: Learn more about using APIs, data analysis, and potentially machine learning.
*The class requirements*
1. Find or create a dataset that interests you.
2. Use software to analyze and answer two questions about the data.
3. Software analysis should include a filter.
4. Software analysis should include a sort.
5. Software analysis should include an aggregation.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. install the required libraries by running the command `pip install flask lets-plot pandas`
2. open the flask directory in the terminal and run the command `flask run`
3. open a web browser and go to the address `http://http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

Instructions for using the software:

1. Open the web application
2. Click on the buttons and see the data analysis

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* I used flask, pandas, and lets-plot libraries
* The application was developed in Python 3.12.6

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Pandas Docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
* [Lets Plot Guide](https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/data-visualise.html)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] use machine learning to predict future stock prices
* [ ] Finsih the css
* [ ] Add more data analysis features
* [ ] Add more data to the dataset and use a SQLite database to store it
